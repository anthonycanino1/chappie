Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------

For a general explanation of energy measurement, check our [webpage](http://kliu20.github.io/jRAPL/).

jRAPL works for Intel microarchitectures of Skylake, Haswell, Sandy Bridge, Sandy Bridge_ep (Server) and Ivy Bridge. Each architecture has different RAPL support.

- Sandy Bridge/Ivy Bridge: uncore GPU, CPU and package support.

- Skylake, Haswell, Sandy Bridge_ep: DRAM, CPU and package support.

You need check which one is your CPU architecture before you use jRAPL.

For more details about RAPL, check the main [reference](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-power-governor)

Pre-requisites for energy measurement
--------------------------------------------------------------

JRAPL only supports Linux system. It currently supports energy measurement and hardware counters measurements.

1) Energy check library uses the Linux kernel `msr` module. To use, type

```
sudo modprobe msr
```
2) Perf counters check library depends on Libpfm4 (http://perfmon2.sourceforge.net/docs_v4.html) library. Therefore, you should go to libpfm with command 
```
cd libpfm/ 
sudo make install 
```
to install necessary libraries and header files on your system.

Build
--------------------------------------------------------------

To generate energy measurement library for JNI, type

```
make lib_shared_CPUScaler
```
To generate hardware counter measurement library for JNI, type

```
make lib_shared_perfChecker
```
To generate both libraries for JNI, type
```
make all
```
How to use
--------------------------------------------------------------

Everytime you need root/sudo access to run the Java code in order to access RAPL MSR.

jRAPL includes the following methods, and it needs to be declared like the following before usage:

- `public native static int ProfileInit();` Initializes jRAPL. Just needs call once in the beginning.

- `public native static String EnergyStatCheck();` It returns a string value, which contains the format of content like: `socket1_gpu/dram_energy#socket1_cpu_energy#socket1_package_energy@socket2_gpu/dram_energy#socket2_cpu_energy#socket2_package_energy`. The character '#' seperates the energy information per the socket. Character '@' seperates different sockets. If it only has one socket, there is no '@'.

- `public native static void ProfileDealloc();`: Free the memory initialized in `ProfileInit()`.

The `EnergyCheckUtils.java` class provide a working sample on how to use jRAPL.


For Perf counter measurement, you don't need root/sudo access to run the library.
It has a seperate set of APIs which include:

- `public native static void perfInit(int numEvents, int isSet);`
- `public native static void singlePerfEventCheck(String eventNames);`
- `public native static void groupPerfEventsCheck(String eventNames);`
- `public native static void perfEnable();`
- `public native static void perfDisable();`
- `public native static void perfSingleRead(int id, long[] buffer);`
- `public native static void perfMultRead(long[] buffer);`
- `public native static long processSingleValue(long[] buffer);`
- `public native static long[] processMultiValue(long[] buffer);`

Energy check and perf counter check can be easily used by accessing helper classes: `EnergyCheckUtils` and `PerfCheckUtils` respectively.

Updates
--------------------------------------------------------------
Support microarchitectures of Skylake and Haswell. (Feb 13 2017)

Support perf hardware counter check. (May 01 2017)



Known limitations
--------------------------------------------------------------

Energy check only works for at most 2 sockets CPU.
